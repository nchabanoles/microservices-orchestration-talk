# TODO

## Packaging
* Create docker image for each service
* Write docker compose to glue all containers together

## Demo Flow
* Non typical usage of a workflow engine
* Actor in a message based architecture
	* Java Micro-Service implementation embedding a H2-InMemory-Bonita-Engine
* Bonita as an orchestrator of micro-services (to ease change)
